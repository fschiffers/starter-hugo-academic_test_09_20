# Hi, I'm Florian. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD with Prof. Cossairt at Northwestern University, focusing on computational display. My academic journey began at Friedrich-Alexander Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, where I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics, and an M.Sc.Hons in Advanced Optical Technologies. During my B.Sc., I worked on my thesis "Calibration of multi-line triangulation 3D sensors" under Prof. Gerd Häusler, with whom I worked for a few years. For my M.Sc. thesis, I delved into Computed Tomography in Talbot-Lau X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging, supervised by Prof. Gisela Anton, Dr. Christian Riess, and Prof. Andreas Maier.

# I had the opportunity to study abroad through the Erasmus program at Universite de Bordeaux, France, and Universidad de Cantabria, Spain, enriching my learning experience and cultural exposure. Transitioning to professional life, I contributed to a project in robotics for image-guided surgery at Siemens Healthineers. Later, I explored machine learning applications in Ophthalmology at Peking University, China.

# My journey led me to Meta, where I worked on research for holographic near-eye displays alongside Doug Lanman and Nathan Matsuda. Now, as I continue with my PhD, I also enjoy teaching. I've been a full instructor for several courses at Northwestern and more details about my teaching experiences can be found on the teaching tab.


# Florian graduated 2017 from [FAU Erlangen](https://www.fau.eu/) in Germany where he received a M.Sc. in [Physics](https://www.physics.nat.fau.eu/)  and a M.Sc.Hons in [Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.maot.studium.fau.de/) . He wrote his thesis on Computed Tomography in Talbot-Lau X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging under the joint supervision of [Prof. Gisela Anton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisela_Anton), [Dr-Ing Christian Riess](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0HGXYNMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Andreas Maier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MA6SDuEAAAAJ&hl=en).

# Prior to this Florian was conducting research in the field of optical 3D sensing in the group of [Prof. Gerd Häusler](https://www.youtube.com/user/Osmin3D) (2012-2015). Later, he worked at [Siemens Healthineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Healthineers) on a pre-development project in robotics for image-guided surgery. After graduation he spent six months at the [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in China with the Department of Biomedical Engineering lead by [Prof. Qiushi Ren](https://bme.pku.edu.cn/) working on machine learning applications in Ophthalmology.

# At [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) Florian is working on algorithm development for inverse problems. He is especially interested on how to enhance conventional techniques, e.g. reconstruction based on physical models, by exploiting the power of data-driven machine learning.  His current projects include imaging through scattering media, extended depth-of-field imaging, tomographic problems with different modalities as well as topographic imaging.
