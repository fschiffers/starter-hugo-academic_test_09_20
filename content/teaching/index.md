My passion for teaching began to take shape at Northwestern University during my PhD studies. Starting out as a Teaching Assistant, I quickly realized the joy in helping students grasp complex concepts, and how fulfilling it was to see their progress. Over the years, I've had the privilege of leading summer courses in Computer Science, a role I eagerly look forward to each year since 2020.

Working with young minds is inspiring. It's not just about passing on knowledge, but about fostering a supportive environment for students to think critically, ask questions, and explore solutions. I consider it a way to give back, sharing what I've learned over the years with the next generation of learners.

I'm excited about the journey of discovery each new teaching opportunity brings, and I'm committed to making learning an engaging and enjoyable experience for my students.

### Remote teaching during COVID pandemic

When I initially took on a significant role as a co-instructor for the Northwestern NUCS 349: Machine Learning course, the unforeseen challenge of COVID-19 emerged, leading to a surprising rise in enrollment from 80 to 170 students within three weeks. Faced with this sudden change, I utilized Campuswire to successfully transition the course online, ensuring an engaging and accessible learning experience for all students during the pandemic. This proactive adaptation not only illustrated the potential of well-organized online classes in addressing unexpected educational challenges, but also led to me being entrusted to teach the course as a full instructor by the summer term. For a more in-depth account of this transition, you can explore the news article [here](https://medium.com/campuswire/from-80-students-to-170-in-three-weeks-3c86d4ee1d9c).

### Overhaul of our Computational Photography Course

During my time as a Teaching Assistant for CS331: Introduction to Computational Photography, I helped transition the course to an online format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This change allowed us to accommodate more participants due to the high demand. For the Fall 2020 term, I created a new set of homework assignments using Python and Jupyter notebooks. The aim was to use Python, a widely used open-source language in Computer Vision research, to gradually introduce students to the various aspects of computational photography, including vision and imaging.

The homework assignments are available for everyone to check out on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NUCS331).
