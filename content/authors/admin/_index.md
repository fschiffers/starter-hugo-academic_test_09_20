I’m a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science]() at [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University), mentored by [Prof. Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/) and specializing in computational display. My primary endeavor is in pioneering Computer Generated Holography for next-generation near-eye displays, and I also hold a keen interest in exploring Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Inverse Problems, and Medical Imaging.

Before delving into my Ph.D., I earned my [Masters in Physics](https://www.physics.nat.fau.eu/studies/bsc-and-msc-in-physics/) in [Erlangen](https://www.fau.de/) and accumulated valuable industry experience at [Siemens Healthineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Healthineers). These experiences have played a pivotal role in shaping my academic and research trajectory.

Recently, I had the opportunity to intern at [Reality Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs), [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms), where I collaborated with [Doug Lanman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-qncsGYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Nathan Matsuda](https://www.nathanmatsuda.com/) to contribute to the evolution of [holographic near-eye displays](https://light.princeton.edu/publication/stochastic_light_field_holography/). Additionally, I have had the enriching experience of being a [full instructor](teaching) for several courses at Northwestern, reinforcing my passion for disseminating knowledge in this multifaceted field.
